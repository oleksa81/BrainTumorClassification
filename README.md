# BrainTumorClassification
Classification of brain tumor types with the following cases: 
(1) no tumor, 
(2) glioma, 
(3) meningioma, 
(4) pituitary 
using Convolutional Neural Networks - Xception, ResNet50, and GoogLeNet.
The aim is to achieve a reasonable accuracy and preserve computational power cost.


Dataset used for this project: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset
which contains 7023 MRIs. It combines the other 3 datasets: figshare, SARTAJ, and Br35H.
